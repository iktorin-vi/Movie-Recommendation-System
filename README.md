🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A simple movie recommendation system that suggests 5 similar movies based on the title you enter. Recommendations are generated by comparing the textual similarity between movies.

How It Works

1. A custom "soup" (combined text field) is created from each movie’s title, genre, overview, and etc.
2. The soup is vectorized using CountVectorizer.
3. Cosine similarity is calculated between the movie vectors.
4. When a user inputs a movie title, the system returns 5 most similar movies.
